# Face-Detection-camera
RPI with servo motors

This project was built on Raspberry Pi .
I used OpenCV in Python detect faces and display it on Desktop camera using pi cam.
The aim of this project was to detect faces and follow them.
Raspberry pi was connected with 4 servo motors which helped the camera to move towards the face.
So, camera follows the face it detected until it finds new face.
